A helper to solve Einstein's Riddle Logic Puzzle

This is a helper to the game Einstein Riddle Logic Puzzle (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rottzgames.logic)
DISCLAIMER: I am not an affiliate or in any way related to the developer of the game.

I wrote this program, initially, to help me solve the puzzle. The game's nature is to deduce any improbable connections. If you can do it manually, then this program is not for you.
There are times, when in INSANE level, I am stuck with too many possibilities. So, I developed this program to help me in solving the puzzle.

Note that this is not a cheat program, you still need to do some deduction. But, upon feeding all the rules in the program, your life will be easier. On the plus note, since it is in CLI mode, people will think you are actually working ;)

These are the commands to put in this helper
p --> to list down possibilities of a given attribute
pr --> to list down possibilities in a row
i --> to insert manually
c --> highlight a column
h --> highlight a row
